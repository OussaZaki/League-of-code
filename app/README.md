## TODO (Help is welcomed)

- ~~Add indexes to the tables (1, 2, 3...)~~
- ~~Add feature to allow Participants to update their data (github url, tags...).~~
- Edit profile on row click.
- The target leaderboard is set for Klarna's internal one. it would be nice to have it supported any private leaderboard through providing the target leaderboard's URL.
